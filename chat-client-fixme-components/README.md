## Chat Client
This repository is a chat-client like the one you built for Chatterbox Client. It has a (mostly) completed HTML/CSS user interface, but is missing a critical feature:

* [ ] Fix the chat client so that a new message is rendered to the chat log as soon as the client knows the server successfully stored the item, rather than waiting for the next timed update (10 seconds later).

Note that this is an exercise in reading code and code reuse, so expect to spend most of your time figuring out where to make change(s) and try to write as little code as possible
